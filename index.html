      <section>
        <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a <em>product engineer</em> with 15 years of professional experience
          building web and mobile applications across various architectures in cloud
          and serverless environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a proven track record building and
          <em>managing happy, cohesive and high-performing engineering teams</em>.
          Iâ€™ve grown into a manager in progressive people-first companies, and I
          have experience making good teams great.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use my strong communication skills to facilitate
          <em>business and engineering working towards shared goals</em>. I am
          equally comfortable in the boardroom as I am in the terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in <em>fostering communities</em>. I speak at conferences, run
          meetups, and contribute to open source software projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly I do my best to be a decent, empathetic
          <em>human being</em> whoâ€™s fun to work with. In my free time I perform
          improv and stand-up comedy, write fiction, and pursue other creative
          endeavours.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="about-you">About you</h2>
        <p>
          You are a <em>mission-driven product company</em> with a clear and ethical
          business model. Youâ€™re most likely in consumer products or development
          tooling space.
        </p>
        <p>
          You care about the <em>social and human impact</em> of your product, and
          understand that user needs are as important as business goals, if not more
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          You value <em>diversity, inclusion and your employeesâ€™ autonomy</em>, and
          demonstrate this with reasonable, flexible working hours and a work from
          home policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are able to give me the <em>freedom to make an impact</em> and not
          strangle me with bureaucracy and micromanagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, youâ€™re based in London, but if all of the above applies to you, I
          am open to relocation and remote roles.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="what-can-i-do-for-you">What can I do for you</h2>
        <p>
          I am interested in either hands-on engineering and management roles in the
          right organisation. Titles are bullsh*t, but most likely youâ€™d hire as a
          Principal/Staff Software Engineer, Engineering Manager, VP/Head of
          Engineering, CTO/CIO, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I care about the impact I can have in your company, and the positive
          impact weâ€™ll have together for the benefit of our users. Here are some of
          the things I can do to achieve these goals:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Architect and implement</em> modern, high-quality web and mobile
          applications and backend systems, combining good programming practices and
          latest tools and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apply Design Thinking and Agile Software Engineering methodologies to
          <em>run the product development lifecycle</em> from conception to
          production.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Build and manage engineering teams</em> with a focus on diversity
          &amp; inclusion and a fun and sustainable work environment, leveraging my
          network and developer advocacy experience in hiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Help your company achieve its goals by
          <em>driving organisational change</em> from top-down, and
          <em>fostering a collaborative, cross-functional team culture</em> from
          bottom-up.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          I believe technology is only a tool, and building great products requires
          a broad application of technologies that no one developer can master. That
          said, my core expertise is in the broader JavaScript ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proficient in web application design and engineering using
          <em>React, GraphQL, TypeScript/Flow</em>, web standards, and various
          frameworks, libraries and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also experienced in native mobile app development using
          <em>React Native</em>, and have shipped multiple applications for iOS and
          Android.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a full-stack developer I have built resilient, large-scale
          <em>Node.js</em> services and deployed them to
          <em>AWS, GCP and Azure</em> in containerised, serverless, and PaaS
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am familiar with modern <em>cloud</em> deployment, hosting and data
          storage and pipelining strategies and microservice architectures, though I
          am by no means an expert.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m also keen to <em>learn new things</em>. Particularly, I am interested
          in ReasonML, Rust/WASM, Kotlin, SwiftUI/Jetpack, and gaining a deeper
          understanding of machine learning and data science.

        <p>Senior Software Engineer (London, 2014-2016)</p>
        <p>
          As a senior full-stack engineer, I typically worked as a customer-facing
          project lead, developing web and mobile applications with React and React
          Native on the frontend, and Node.js or Clojure on the backend. I am a
          Certified Scrum Master, and in addition to building products, I focused on
          building teams that work effectively and made our customers succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the most senior developer in our London office, I coached teams,
          mentored junior developers, and provided training and specialist
          consultancy to other Futurice projects across Europe. I worked actively in
          recruitment, identifying, approaching and interviewing potential Futurice
          talent, hiring approximately one new team member per month.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also supported business development, spoke at industry meet-ups,
          developed open source projects to increase our visibility in the market,
          and advised on technology in new customer relationships.

        <p>Lead Developer (Helsinki, 2011-2014)</p>
        <p>
          I spearheaded Fifth Elementâ€™s vision of HTML5-driven mobile hybrid
          applications for the Enterprise. I was the lead developer of the companyâ€™s
          flagship product LogForce, a suite of Backbone.js-backed web and mobile
          apps for increasing the productivity of Finnish forest industry logistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved on to work as the technical architect and client-side lead of the
          productâ€™s big brother, WoodForce, which aims to do the same for the
          harvesting industry, running on AngularJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to working on our products, I hosted code camps and hackathons
          for my colleagues and participated in project sales. Prior to my lead role
          in product development, I also worked on .NET-based mobile and desktop
          geoinformation applications for our consultancy business.

          campaigns, mainly using ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC and legacy systems.

          design, mostly simple HTML/CSS-based websites for small businesses. Thank
          god nobody in Finland had yet heard of Wordpress, or I wouldâ€™ve been out
